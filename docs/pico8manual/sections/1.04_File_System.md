---------------

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#_File_System)

These commands can be used to manage files and directories (folders):

LS          list the current directory  
CD BLAH     change directory  
CD ..       go up a directory  
CD /        change back to top directory (on PICO-8's virtual drive)  
MKDIR BLAH  make a directory  
FOLDER      open the current directory in the host operating system's file browser  

LOAD BLAH load a cart from the current directory SAVE BLAH save a cart to the current directory

If you want to move files around, duplicate them or delete them, use the FOLDER command and do it in the host operating system.

The default location for PICO-8's drive is:

Windows: C:/Users/Yourname/AppData/Roaming/pico-8/carts  
OSX: /Users/Yourname/Library/Application Support/pico-8/carts  
Linux: ~/.lexaloffle/pico-8/carts  

You can change this and other settings in pico-8/config.txt

Tip: The drive directory can be mapped to a cloud drive (provided by Dropbox, Google Drive or similar) in order to create a single disk shared between PICO-8 machines spread across different host machines.
