1.7 Backups
-----------

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#_Backups)

When quitting without saving changes, or overwriting an existing file, a backup of the cartridge is saved to {appdata}/pico-8/backup. An extra copy of the current cartridge can also be saved to the same folder by typing BACKUP.

To open the backups folder in the host operating system's file browser, use:

\> FOLDER BACKUPS  

It is then possible to drag and drop files into the PICO-8 window to load them.

From 0.2.4c, periodic backups are also saved every 20 minutes when not idle in the editor, which means the backups folder will grow by about 1MB every 5 hours. This can be disabled or adjusted in config.txt
