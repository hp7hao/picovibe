##### SFX(N, \[CHANNEL\], \[OFFSET\], \[LENGTH\])

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#SFX)

Play sfx N (0..63) on CHANNEL (0..3) from note OFFSET (0..31 in notes) for LENGTH notes.

Using negative CHANNEL values have special meanings:

CHANNEL -1: (default) to automatically choose a channel that is not being used  
CHANNEL -2: to stop the given sound from playing on any channel  

N can be a command for the given CHANNEL (or all channels when CHANNEL < 0):

N -1: to stop sound on that channel  
N -2: to release sound on that channel from looping  

SFX(3)    --  PLAY SFX 3  
SFX(3,2)  --  PLAY SFX 3 ON CHANNEL 2  
SFX(3,-2) --  STOP SFX 3 FROM PLAYING ON ANY CHANNEL  
SFX(-1,2) --  STOP WHATEVER IS PLAYING ON CHANNEL 2  
SFX(-2,2) --  RELEASE LOOPING ON CHANNEL 2  
SFX(-1)   --  STOP ALL SOUNDS ON ALL CHANNELS  
SFX(-2)   --  RELEASE LOOPING ON ALL CHANNELS

##### MUSIC(N, \[FADE\_LEN\], \[CHANNEL\_MASK\])

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#MUSIC)

Play music starting from pattern N (0..63)  
N -1 to stop music

  FADE\_LEN is in ms (default: 0). So to fade pattern 0 in over 1 second:

MUSIC(0, 1000)  

CHANNEL\_MASK specifies which channels to reserve for music only. For example, to play only on channels 0..2:

MUSIC(0, NIL, 7) -- 1 | 2 | 4

Reserved channels can still be used to play sound effects on, but only when that channel index is explicitly requested by [**SFX**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#SFX)().
