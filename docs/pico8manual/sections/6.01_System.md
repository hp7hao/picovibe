❻ API Reference
---------------

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#API_Reference)

PICO-8 is built on the Lua programming language, but does not include the Lua standard library. Instead, a small api is offered in keeping with PICO-8's minimal design and limited screen space. For an example program that uses most of the api functions, see /DEMOS/API.P8

Functions are written here as:

FUNCTION\_NAME(PARAMETER, \[OPTIONAL\_PARAMETER\])

ⓘ

Note that PICO-8 does not have upper or lower case characters -- if you are editing a .p8 or .lua file directly, function names should all be in lower case.

6.1 System
----------

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#System)

System functions called from commandline can omit the usual brackets and string quotes. For example, instead of LOAD("BLAH.P8"), it is possible to write:

\>LOAD BLAH.P8  

  
[

##### LOAD(FILENAME, \[BREADCRUMB\], \[PARAM\_STR\])

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#LOAD)[

##### SAVE(FILENAME)

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#SAVE)

Load or save a cartridge

When loading from a running cartridge, the loaded cartridge is immediately run with parameter string PARAM\_STR (accessible with STAT(6)), and a menu item is inserted and named BREADCRUMB, that returns the user to the previous cartridge.

Filenames that start with '#' are taken to be a BBS cart id, that is immediately downloaded and run:

\> LOAD("#MYGAME\_LEVEL2", "BACK TO MAP", "LIVES="..LIVES)  

If the id is the cart's parent post, or a revision number is not specified, then the latest version is fetched. BBS carts can be loaded from other BBS carts or local carts, but not from exported carts.

  
[

##### FOLDER

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#FOLDER)

Open the carts folder in the host operating system.

  
[

##### LS(\[DIRECTORY\])

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#LS)

List .p8 and .p8.png files in given directory (folder), relative to the current directory. Items that are directories end in a slash (e.g. "foo/").

When called from a running cartridge, LS can only be used locally and returns a table of the results. When called from a BBS cart, LS returns nil.

Directories can only resolve inside of PICO-8's virtual drive; LS("..") from the root directory will resolve to the root directory.

  
[

##### RUN(\[PARAM\_STR\])

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#RUN)

Run from the start of the program.

RUN() Can be called from inside a running program to reset.

When PARAM\_STR is supplied, it can be accessed during runtime with STAT(6)

  
[

##### STOP(\[MESSAGE\])

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#STOP)

Stop the cart and optionally print a message.

  
[

##### RESUME

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#RESUME)

Resume the program. Use R for short.

Use a single "." from the commandline to advance a single frame. This enters frame-by-frame mode, that can be read with stat(110). While frame-by-frame mode is active, entering an empty command (by pressing enter) advances one frames.

  
[

##### ASSERT(CONDITION, \[MESSAGE\])

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#ASSERT)

If CONDITION is false, stop the program and print MESSAGE if it is given. This can be useful for debugging cartridges, by ASSERT()'ing that things that you expect to be true are indeed true.

ASSERT(ADDR >= 0 AND ADDR <= 0x7FFF, "OUT OF RANGE")  
POKE(ADDR, 42) -- THE MEMORY ADDRESS IS OK, FOR SURE!  

  
[

##### REBOOT

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#REBOOT)

Reboot the machine Useful for starting a new project

  
[

##### RESET()

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#RESET)

Reset the values in RAM from 0x5f00..0x5f7f to their default values. This includes the palette, camera position, clipping and fill pattern. If you get lost at the command prompt because the draw state makes viewing text impossible, try typing RESET! It can also be called from a running program.

  
[

##### INFO()

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#INFO)

Print out some information about the cartridge: Code size, tokens, compressed size

Also displayed:

UNSAVED CHANGES   When the cartridge in memory differs to the one on disk  
EXTERNAL CHANGES  When the cartridge on disk has changed since it was loaded  
  (e.g. by editing the program using a separate text editor)  

  
[

##### FLIP()

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#FLIP)

Flip the back buffer to screen and wait for next frame. This call is not needed when there is a [**\_DRAW**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#_DRAW)() or [**\_UPDATE**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#_UPDATE)() callback defined, as the flip is performed automatically. But when using a custom main loop, a call to FLIP is normally needed:

::\_::  
CLS()  
FOR I=1,100 DO  
  A=I/50 - T()  
  X=64+COS(A)\*I  
  Y=64+SIN(A)\*I  
  CIRCFILL(X,Y,1,8+(I/4)%8)  
END  
FLIP()GOTO \_  

If your program does not call FLIP before a frame is up, and a [**\_DRAW**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#_DRAW)() callback is not in progress, the current contents of the back buffer are copied to screen.

  
[

##### PRINTH(STR, \[FILENAME\], \[OVERWRITE\], \[SAVE\_TO\_DESKTOP\])

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#PRINTH)

Print a string to the host operating system's console for debugging.

If filename is set, append the string to a file on the host operating system (in the current directory by default -- use FOLDER to view).

Setting OVERWRITE to true causes that file to be overwritten rather than appended.

Setting SAVE\_TO\_DESKTOP to true saves to the desktop instead of the current path.

Use a filename of "@clip" to write to the host's clipboard.

ⓘ

Use stat(4) to read the clipboard, but the contents of the clipboard are only available after pressing CTRL-V during runtime (for security).

  
[

##### TIME()

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#TIME)[

##### T()

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#T)

Returns the number of seconds elapsed since the cartridge was run.

This is not the real-world time, but is calculated by counting the number of times

  
[

##### \_UPDATE or @\_UPDATE60 is called. Multiple calls of TIME() from the same frame return

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#_UPDATE)

the same result.

  
[

##### STAT(X)

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#STAT)

Get system status where X is:

0  Memory usage (0..2048)  
1  CPU used since last flip (1.0 == 100% CPU)  
4  Clipboard contents (after user has pressed CTRL-V)  
6  Parameter string  
7  Current framerate

  46..49  Index of currently playing SFX on channels 0..3  
50..53  Note number (0..31) on channel 0..3  
54      Currently playing pattern index  
55      Total patterns played  
56      Ticks played on current pattern  
57      (Boolean) TRUE when music is playing

  80..85  UTC time: year, month, day, hour, minute, second  
90..95  Local time

  100     Current breadcrumb label, or nil  
110     Returns true when in frame-by-frame mode

ⓘ

Audio values 16..26 are the legacy version of audio state queries 46..56. They only report on the current state of the audio mixer, which changes only ~20 times a second (depending on the host sound driver and other factors). 46..56 instead stores a history of mixer state at each tick to give a higher resolution estimate of the currently audible state.

  
[

##### EXTCMD(CMD\_STR, \[P1, P2\])

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#EXTCMD)

Special system command, where CMD\_STR is a string:

"pause"         request the pause menu be opened  
"reset"         request a cart reset  
"go\_back"       return to the previous cart if there is one  
"label"         set cart label  
"screen"        save a screenshot  
"rec"           set video start point  
"rec\_frames"    set video start point in frames mode  
"video"         save a .gif to desktop  
"audio\_rec"     start recording audio  
"audio\_end"     save recorded audio to desktop (no supported from web)  
"shutdown"      quit cartridge (from exported binary)  
"folder"        open current working folder on the host operating system  
"set\_filename"  set the filename for screenshots / gifs / audio recordings  
"set\_title"     set the host window title  

Some commands have optional number parameters:

"video" and "screen": P1: an integer scaling factor that overrides the system setting. P2: when > 0, save to the current folder instead of to desktop

"audio\_end" P1: when > 0, save to the current folder instead of to desktop

[

#### ■ Recording GIFs

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Recording_GIFs)

EXTCMD("REC"), EXTCMD("VIDEO") is the same as using ctrl-8, ctrl-9 and saves a gif to the desktop using the current GIF\_SCALE setting (use CONFIG GIF\_SCALE to change).

The two additional parameters can be used to override these defaults:

EXTCMD("VIDEO", 4)    -- SCALE \*4 (512 X 512)  
EXTCMD("VIDEO", 0, 1) -- DEFAULT SCALING, SAVE TO USER DATA FOLDER  

The user data folder can be opened with EXTCMD("FOLDER") and defaults to the same path as the cartridge, or {pico-8 appdata}/appdata/appname for exported binaries.

Due to the nature of the gif format, all gifs are recorded at 33.3fps, and frames produced by PICO-8 are skipped or duplicated in the gif to match roughly what the user is seeing. To record exactly one frame each time [**FLIP**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#FLIP)() is called, regardless of the runtime framerate or how long it took to generate the frame, use:

EXTCMD("REC\_FRAMES")  

The default filename for gifs (and screenshots, audio) is foo\_%d, where foo is the name of the cartridge, and %d is a number starting at 0 and automatically incremented until a file of that name does not exist. Use EXTCMD("SET\_FILENAME","FOO") to override that default. If the custom filename includes "%d", then the auto- incrementing number behaviour is used, but otherwise files are written even if there is an existing file with the same name.
