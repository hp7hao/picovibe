3.1 Web Applications (.html)

To generate a stand-alone html player (mygame.html, mygame.js):

\> EXPORT MYGAME.HTML  

Or just the .js file:

\> EXPORT MYGAME.JS  

Use -f to write the files to a folder called mygame\_html, using index.html instead of mygame.html

\> EXPORT -F MYGAME.HTML  

Optionally provide a custom html template with the -p switch:

\> EXPORT MYGAME.HTML -P ONE\_BUTTON  

This will use the file {application data}/pico-8/plates/one\_button.html as the html shell, replacing a special string "##js\_file##" (without quotes), with the .js filename, and optionally replacing the string "##label\_file##" with the cart's label image as a data url.

Use -w to export as .wasm + .js:

\> EXPORT -W MYGAME.HTML  

â“˜

When exported as .wasm, the page needs to be served by a webserver, rather than just opening it directly from the local file system in a browser. For most purposes, the default .js export is fine, but .wasm is slightly smaller and faster.
