3.4 Exporting Multiple Cartridges
---------------------------------

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Exporting_Multiple_Cartridges)

Up to 32 cartridges can be bundled together by passing them to EXPORT, when generating stand-alone html or native binary players.

\> EXPORT MYGAME.HTML DAT1.P8 DAT2.P8 GAME2.P8  

During runtime, the extra carts can be accessed as if they were local files:

RELOAD(0,0,0X2000, "DAT1.P8") -- LOAD SPRITESHEET FROM DAT1.P8  
LOAD("GAME2.P8")              -- LOAD AND RUN ANOTHER CART  

ⓘ

Exported cartridges are unable to load and run BBS cartridges e.g. via LOAD("#FOO")
