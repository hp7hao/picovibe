❸ Exporters / Importers
-----------------------

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#_Exporters_)

The EXPORT command can be used to generate png, wav files and stand-alone html and native binary cartridge applications. The output format is inferred from the filename extension (e.g. .png).

You are free to distribute and use exported cartridges and data as you please, provided that you have permission from the cartridge author and contributors.

### ▨ Sprite Sheet / Label (.png)

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Sprite_Sheet_)

\> IMPORT BLAH.PNG   -- EXPECTS 128X128 PNG AND COLOUR-FITS TO THE PICO-8 PALETTE  
\> EXPORT BLAH.PNG   -- USE THE "FOLDER" COMMAND TO LOCATE THE EXPORTED PNG  

When importing, -x and -y switches can be used to specify the target location in pixels: -s can be used to shrink the image (3 means scale from 384x384 -> 128x128)

\> IMPORT BLAH.PNG -X 16 -Y 16 -S 3  

Use the -l switch with IMPORT and EXPORT to instead read and write from the cartridge's label:

\> IMPORT -L BLAH.PNG  

ⓘ

When importing spritesheets or labels, the palette is colour-fitted to the current draw state palette.

### ▨ SFX and Music (.wav)

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#SFX_and_Music_)

To export music from the current pattern (when editor mode is MUSIC), or the current SFX:

\> EXPORT FOO.WAV    

To export all SFXs as foo0.wav, foo1.wav .. foo63.wav:

\> EXPORT FOO%D.WAV  

[

### ▨ MAP and CODE

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#MAP_and_CODE)

A cartridges map or source code can be exported as a single image named .map.png or .lua.png:

\> EXPORT FOO.MAP.PNG  
\> EXPORT FOO.LUA.PNG  

Map images are 1024x512 (128x32 8x8 sprites). Lua images are sized to fit, but each line is fixed (and cropped) at 192 pixels wide.

### ▨ Cartridges (.p8, .p8.png, .p8.rom)

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Cartridges_)

Using EXPORT to save a cartridge is the same as using SAVE, but without changing the current working cartridge. This can be useful for example, to save a copy in .p8.png format for distribution without accidentally continuing to make changes to that file instead of the original .p8 file.

EXPORT can also be used to perform cartridge file format conversions from commandline. For example, from a Linux shell:

\> pico8 foo.p8 -export foo.p8.png
