------------------------

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Uploading_to_itch)

If you would like to upload your exported cartridge to itch.io as playable html:

1\. From inside PICO-8: EXPORT -F MYGAME.HTML  
2\. Create a new project from your itch dashboard.  
3\. Zip up the folder and upload it (set "This file will be played in the browser")  
4\. Embed in page, with a size of 750px x 680px.  
5\. Set "Mobile Friendly" on (default orientation) and "Automatically start on page load" on.  
Â  // no need for the fullscreen button as the default PICO-8 template has its own.  
6\. Set the background (BG2) to something dark (e.g. #232323) and the text to something light (#cccccc)
