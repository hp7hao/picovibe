6.13 Mouse and Keyboard Input
-----------------------------

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Mouse_and_Keyboard_Input)

// EXPERIMENTAL -- but mostly working on all platforms

Mouse and keyboard input can be achieved by enabling devkit input mode:

POKE(0x5F2D, flags) -- where flags are:

0x1 Enable  
0x2 Mouse buttons trigger btn(4)..btn(6)  
0x4 Pointer lock (use stat 38..39 to read movements)  

Note that not every PICO-8 will have a keyboard or mouse attached to it, so when posting carts to the Lexaloffle BBS, it is encouraged to make keyboard and/or mouse control optional and off by default, if possible. When devkit input mode is enabled, a message is displayed to BBS users warning them that the program may be expecting input beyond the standard 6-button controllers.

The state of the mouse and keyboard can be found in stat(x):

STAT(30) -- (Boolean) True when a keypress is available  
STAT(31) -- (String) character returned by keyboard  
STAT(32) -- Mouse X  
STAT(33) -- Mouse Y  
STAT(34) -- Mouse buttons (bitfield)  
STAT(36) -- Mouse wheel event  
STAT(38) -- Relative x movement (in host desktop pixels) -- requires flag 0x4  
STAT(39) -- Relative y movement (in host desktop pixels) -- requires flag 0x4
