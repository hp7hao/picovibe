##### BTN(\[B\], \[PL\])

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#BTN)

Get button B state for player PL (default 0)

B: 0..5: left right up down button\_o button\_x  
PL: player index 0..7

Instead of using a number for B, it is also possible to use a button glyph. (In the coded editor, use Shift-L R U D O X)

If no parameters supplied, returns a bitfield of all 12 button states for player 0 & 1 // P0: bits 0..5 P1: bits 8..13

Default keyboard mappings to player buttons:

    player 0: \[DPAD\]: cursors, \[O\]: Z C N   \[X\]: X V M  
  player 1: \[DPAD\]: SFED,    \[O\]: LSHIFT  \[X\]: TAB W  Q A

⚠

Although PICO-8 accepts all button combinations, note that it is generally impossible to press both LEFT and RIGHT at the same time on a physical game controller. On some controllers, UP + LEFT/RIGHT is also awkward if \[X\] or \[O\] could be used instead of UP (e.g. to jump / accelerate).

##### BTNP(B, \[PL\])

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#BTNP)

BTNP is short for "Button Pressed"; Instead of being true when a button is held down, BTNP returns true when a button is down AND it was not down the last frame. It also repeats after 15 frames, returning true every 4 frames after that (at 30fps -- double that at 60fps). This can be used for things like menu navigation or grid-wise player movement.

The state that BTNP reads is reset at the start of each call to [**\_UPDATE**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#_UPDATE) or [**\_UPDATE60**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#_UPDATE60), so it is preferable to use BTNP from inside one of those functions.

Custom delays (in frames [](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#)30fps) can be set by poking the following memory addresses:

POKE(0X5F5C, DELAY) -- SET THE INITIAL DELAY BEFORE REPEATING. 255 MEANS NEVER REPEAT.  
POKE(0X5F5D, DELAY) -- SET THE REPEATING DELAY.  

In both cases, 0 can be used for the default behaviour (delays 15 and 4)
