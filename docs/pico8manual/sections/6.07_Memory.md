6.7 Memory
----------

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Memory)

PICO-8 has 3 types of memory:

1\. Base RAM (64k): see layout below. Access with PEEK() POKE() MEMCPY() MEMSET()  
2\. Cart ROM (32k): same layout as base ram until 0x4300  
3\. Lua RAM (2MB): compiled program + variables  

ⓘ

  
Technical note: While using the editor, the data being modified is in cart rom, but api functions such as [**SPR**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#SPR)() and [**SFX**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#SFX)() only operate on base ram. PICO-8 automatically copies cart rom to base ram (i.e. calls [**RELOAD**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#RELOAD)()) in 3 cases:  
1\. When a cartridge is loaded  
2\. When a cartridge is run  
3\. When exiting any of the editor modes // can turn off with: poke(0x5f37,1)

#### ■ Base RAM Memory Layout

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Base_RAM_Memory_Layout)

0X0    GFX  
0X1000 GFX2/MAP2 (SHARED)  
0X2000 MAP  
0X3000 GFX FLAGS  
0X3100 SONG  
0X3200 SFX  
0X4300 USER DATA  
0X5600 CUSTOM FONT (IF ONE IS DEFINED)  
0X5E00 PERSISTENT CART DATA (256 BYTES)  
0X5F00 DRAW STATE  
0X5F40 HARDWARE STATE  
0X5F80 GPIO PINS (128 BYTES)  
0X6000 SCREEN (8K)  
0x8000 USER DATA  

User data has no particular meaning and can be used for anything via [**MEMCPY**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#MEMCPY)(), [**PEEK**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#PEEK)() & [**POKE**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#POKE)(). Persistent cart data is mapped to 0x5e00..0x5eff but only stored if [**CARTDATA**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#CARTDATA)() has been called. Colour format (gfx/screen) is 2 pixels per byte: low bits encode the left pixel of each pair. Map format is one byte per tile, where each byte normally encodes a sprite index.

#### ■ Remapping Graphics and Map Data

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Remapping_Graphics_and_Map_Data)

The GFX, MAP and SCREEN memory areas can be reassigned by setting values at the following addresses:

0X5F54 GFX:    can be 0x00 (default) or 0x60 (use the screen memory as the spritesheet)  
0X5F55 SCREEN: can be 0x60 (default) or 0x00 (use the spritesheet as screen memory)  
0X5F56 MAP:    can be 0x20 (default) or 0x10..0x2f, or 0x80 and above.  
0X5F57 MAP SIZE: map width. 0 means 256. Defaults to 128.  

Addresses can be expressed in 256 byte increments. So 0x20 means 0x2000, 0x21 means 0x2100 etc. Map addresses 0x30..0x3f are taken to mean 0x10..0x1f (shared memory area). Map data can only be contained inside the memory regions 0x1000..0x2fff, 0x8000..0xffff, and the map height is determined to be the largest possible size that fits in the given region.

GFX and SCREEN addresses can additionally be mapped to upper memory locations 0x80, 0xA0, 0xC0, 0xE0, with the constraint that MAP can not overlap with that address (in this case, the conflicting GFX and/or SCREEN mappings are kicked back to their default mapping).

ⓘ

GFX and SCREEN memory mapping happens at a low level which also affects memory access functions (peek, poke, memcpy). The 8k memory blocks starting at 0x0 and 0x6000 can be thought of as pointers to a separate video ram, and setting the values at 0X5F54 and 0X5F56 alters those pointers.

  
[

##### PEEK(ADDR, \[N\])

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#PEEK)

Read a byte from an address in base ram. If N is specified, PEEK() returns that number of results (max: 8192). For example, to read the first 2 bytes of video memory:

A, B = PEEK(0x6000, 2)  

  
[

##### POKE(ADDR, VAL1, VAL2, ...)

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#POKE)

Write one or more bytes to an address in base ram. If more than one parameter is provided, they are written sequentially (max: 8192).

  
[

##### PEEK2(ADDR)

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#PEEK2)[

##### POKE2(ADDR, VAL)

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#POKE2)[

##### PEEK4(ADDR)

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#PEEK4)[

##### POKE4(ADDR, VAL)

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#POKE4)

16-bit and 32-bit versions of PEEK and POKE. Read and write one number (VAL) in little-endian format:

  16 bit: 0xffff.0000  
  32 bit: 0xffff.ffff  

ADDR does not need to be aligned to 2 or 4-byte boundaries.

Alternatively, the following operators can be used to peek (but not poke), and are slightly faster:

@ADDR  -- PEEK(ADDR)  
%ADDR  -- PEEK2(ADDR)  
$ADDR  -- PEEK4(ADDR)  

  
[

##### MEMCPY(DEST\_ADDR, SOURCE\_ADDR, LEN)

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#MEMCPY)

Copy LEN bytes of base ram from source to dest. Sections can be overlapping

  
[

##### RELOAD(DEST\_ADDR, SOURCE\_ADDR LEN, \[FILENAME\])

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#RELOAD)

Same as MEMCPY, but copies from cart rom.

The code section ( >= 0x4300) is protected and can not be read.

If filename specified, load data from a separate cartridge. In this case, the cartridge must be local (BBS carts can not be read in this way).

  
[

##### CSTORE(DEST\_ADDR, SOURCE\_ADDR, LEN, \[FILENAME\])

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#CSTORE)

Same as memcpy, but copies from base ram to cart rom.

CSTORE() is equivalent to CSTORE(0, 0, 0x4300)

The code section ( >= 0x4300) is protected and can not be written to.

If FILENAME is specified, the data is written directly to that cartridge on disk. Up to 64 cartridges can be written in one session. See [**Cartridge Data**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Cartridge_Data) for more information.

  
[

##### MEMSET(DEST\_ADDR, VAL, LEN)

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#MEMSET)

Write the 8-bit value VAL into memory starting at DEST\_ADDR, for LEN bytes.

For example, to fill half of video memory with 0xC8:

\> MEMSET(0x6000, 0xC8, 0x1000)
