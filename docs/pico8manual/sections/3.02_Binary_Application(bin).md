3.2 Binary Applications (.bin)

To generate stand-alone executables for Windows, Linux (64-bit), Mac and Raspberry Pi:

\> EXPORT MYGAME.BIN  

By default, the cartridge label is used as an icon with no transparency. To specify an icon from the sprite sheet, use -i and optionally -s and/or -c to control the size and transparency.

\-I N  Icon index N with a default transparent colour of 0 (black).  
\-S N  Size NxN sprites. Size 3 would be produce a 24x24 icon.  
\-C N  Treat colour N as transparent. Use 16 for no transparency.  

For example, to use a 2x2 sprite starting at index 32 in the sprite sheet, using colour 12 as transparent:

\> EXPORT -I 32 -S 2 -C 12 MYGAME.BIN  

To include an extra file in the output folders and archives, use the -E switch:

\> EXPORT -E README.TXT MYGAME.BIN  

ⓘ

Windows file systems do not support the file metadata needed to create a Linux or Mac executable. PICO-8 works around this by exporting zip files in a way that preserves the file attributes. It is therefore recommended that you distribute the outputted zip files as-is to ensure users on other operating systems can run them. Otherwise, a Linux user who then downloads the binaries may need to "chmod +x mygame" the file to run it, and Mac user would need to "chmod +x mygame.app/Contents/MacOS/mygame"
