1.9 Screenshots and GIFS
------------------------

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#_Screenshots_and_GIFS)

While a cartridge is running use:

CTRL-6 Save a screenshot to desktop  
CTRL-7 Capture cartridge label image  
CTRL-8 Start recording a video  
CTRL-9 Save GIF video to desktop (8 seconds by default)  

You can save a video at any time (it is always recording); CTRL-8 simply resets the video starting point. To record more than 8 seconds, use the CONFIG command (maximum: 120)

CONFIG GIF\_LEN 60  

If you would like the recording to reset every time (to create a non-overlapping sequence), use:

CONFIG GIF\_RESET\_MODE 1  

The gif format can not match 30fps exactly, so PICO-8 instead uses the closest match: 33.3fps.

If you have trouble saving to the desktop, try configuring an alternative desktop path in config.txt
