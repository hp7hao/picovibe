3.5 Running EXPORT from the host operating system
-------------------------------------------------

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Running_EXPORT_from_the_host_operating_system)

Use the -export switch when launching PICO-8 to run the exporter in headless mode. File paths are relative to the current directory rather than the PICO-8 file system.

Parameters to the EXPORT command are passed along as a single (lowercase) string:

pico8 mygame.p8 -export "-i 32 -s 2 -c 12 mygame.bin dat0.p8 dat1.p8"
