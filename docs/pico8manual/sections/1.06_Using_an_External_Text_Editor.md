1.6 Using an External Text Editor
---------------------------------

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#_Using_an_External_Text_Editor)

It is possible to edit .p8 files directly with a separate text editor. Using CTRL-R to run a cartridge will automatically re-load the file if:

1\. There are no unsaved changes in the PICO-8 editors, AND  
2\. The file differs in content from the last loaded version.

If there are changes to both the cart on disk and in the editor, a notification is displayed:

DIDN'T RELOAD; UNSAVED CHANGES  

Alternatively, .lua text files can be modified in a separate editor and then included into the cartridge's code each time it is run using [**#INCLUDE**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#_INCLUDE) (in the desired code location):

#INCLUDE YOURFILE.LUA
