1.2 Hello World

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#_Hello_World)

After PICO-8 boots, try typing some of these commands followed by enter:

\> PRINT("HELLO WORLD")  
\> RECTFILL(80,80,120,100,12)  
\> CIRCFILL(70,90,20,14)  
\> FOR I=1,4 DO PRINT(I) END  

(Note: PICO-8 only displays upper-case characters -- just type normally without capslock!)

You can build up an interactive program by using commands like this in the code editing mode along with two special callback functions [**\_UPDATE**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#_UPDATE) and [**\_DRAW**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#_DRAW). For example, the following program allows you to move a circle around with the cursor keys. Press Esc to switch to the code editor and type or copy & paste the following code:

X = 64  Y = 64  
FUNCTION \_UPDATE()  
  IF (BTN(0)) THEN X=X-1 END  
  IF (BTN(1)) THEN X=X+1 END  
  IF (BTN(2)) THEN Y=Y-1 END  
  IF (BTN(3)) THEN Y=Y+1 END  
END

  FUNCTION \_DRAW()  
  CLS(5)  
  CIRCFILL(X,Y,7,14)  
END

Now press Esc to return to the console and type RUN (or press CTRL-R) to see it in action. Please refer to the demo cartridges for more complex programs (type INSTALL\_DEMOS).

If you want to store your program for later, use the SAVE command:

\> SAVE PINKCIRC  

And to load it again:

\> LOAD PINKCIRC
