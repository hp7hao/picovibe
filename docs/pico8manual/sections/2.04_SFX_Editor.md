2.4 SFX Editor
--------------

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#SFX_Editor)

There are 64 SFX ("sound effects") in a cartridge, used for both sound and music.

Each SFX has 32 notes, and each note has:  
  A frequency   (C0..C5)  
  An instrument (0..7)  
  A volume      (0..7)  
  An effect     (0..7)  

Each SFX also has these properties:

  A play speed (SPD) : the number of 'ticks' to play each note for.  
    // This means that 1 is fastest, 3 is 3x as slow, etc.

    Loop start and end : this is the note index to loop back and to  
    // Looping is turned off when the start index >= end index

When only the first of the 2 numbers is used (and the second one is 0), it is taken to mean the number of notes to be played. This is normally not needed for sound effects (you can just leave the remaining notes empty), but is useful for controlling music playback.

There are 2 modes for editing/viewing a SFX: Pitch mode (more suitable for sound effects) and tracker mode (more suitable for music). The mode can be changed using the top-left buttons, or toggled with TAB.

[

### ▨ Pitch Mode

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Pitch_Mode)

Click and drag on the pitch area to set the frequency for each note, using the currently selected instrument (indicated by colour).

Hold shift to apply only the selected instrument.  
Hold CTRL to snap entered notes to the C minor pentatonic scale.  
Right click to grab the instrument of that note.

### ▨ Tracker Mode

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Tracker_Mode)

Each note shows: frequency octave instrument volume effect  
To enter a note, use q2w3er5t6y7ui zsxdcvgbhnjm (piano-like layout)  
Hold shift when entering a note to transpose -1 octave .. +1 octave  
New notes are given the selected instrument/effect values  
To delete a note, use backspace or set the volume to 0  

Click and then shift-click to select a range that can be copied (CTRL-C) and pasted (CTRL-V). Note that only the selected attributes are copied. Double-click to select all attributes of a single note.

Navigation:  
  PAGEUP/DOWN or CTRL-UP/DOWN to skip up or down 4 notes  
  HOME/END to jump to the first or last note  
  CTRL-LEFT/RIGHT to jump across columns

\- + to navigate the current SFX  
< > to change the speed. SPACE to play/stop  
SHIFT-SPACE to play from the current SFX quarter (group of 8 notes)  
A to release a looping sample  
Left click or right click to increase / decrease the SPD or LOOP values  
  // Hold shift when clicking to increase / decrease by 4  
  // Alternatively, click and drag left/right or up/down  
Shift-click an instrument, effect, or volume to apply to all notes.

### ▨ Effects

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Effects)

0 none  
1 slide          //  Slide to the next note and volume  
2 vibrato        //  Rapidly vary the pitch within one quarter-tone  
3 drop           //  Rapidly drop the frequency to very low values  
4 fade in        //  Ramp the volume up from 0  
5 fade out       //  Ramp the volume down to 0  
6 arpeggio fast  //  Iterate over groups of 4 notes at speed of 4  
7 arpeggio slow  //  Iterate over groups of 4 notes at speed of 8  

If the SFX speed is <= 8, arpeggio speeds are halved to 2, 4

### ▨ Filters

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Filters)

Each SFX has 5 filter switches that can be accessed while in tracker mode:

NOIZ:      Generate pure white noise (applies only to instrument 6)  
BUZZ:      Various alterations to the waveform to make it sound more buzzy  
DETUNE-1:  Detunes a second voice to create a flange-like effect  
DETUNE-2:  Various second voice tunings, mostly up or down an octave  
REVERB:    Apply an echo with a delay of 2 or 4 ticks  
DAMPEN:    Low pass filter at 2 different levels  

When BUZZ is used with instrument 6, and NOIZ is off, pure brown noise is generated.
