GPIO stands for "General Purpose Input Output", and allows machines to communicate with each other. PICO-8 maps bytes in the range 0x5f80..0x5fff to gpio pins that can be

##### POKE()ed (to output a value -- e.g. to make an LED light up) or @PEEK()ed (e.g. to read

the state of a switch).

GPIO means different things for different host platforms:

CHIP:         0x5f80..0x5f87 mapped to xio-p0..xio-p7  
Pocket CHIP:  0x5f82..0x5f87 mapped to GPIO1..GPIO6  
  // xio-p0 & p1 are exposed inside the prototyping area inside the case.  
Raspberry Pi: 0x5f80..0x5f9f mapped to wiringPi pins 0..31  
  // see http://wiringpi.com/pins/ for mappings on different models.  
  // also: watch out for BCM vs. WiringPi GPIO indexing!  

CHIP and Raspberry Pi values are all digital: 0 (LOW) and 255 (HIGH)

A program to blink any LEDs attached on and off:

T = 0  
FUNCTION \_DRAW()  
 CLS(5)  
 FOR I=0,7 DO  
  VAL = 0  
  IF (T % 2 < 1) VAL = 255  
  POKE(0X5F80 + I, VAL)  
  CIRCFILL(20+I\*12,64,4,VAL/11)  
 END  
 T += 0.1  
END

#### ■ Serial

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Serial)

For more precise timing, the [**SERIAL**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#SERIAL)() command can be used. GPIO writes are buffered and dispatched at the end of each frame, allowing clock cycling at higher and/or more regular speeds than is possible by manually bit-banging using [**POKE**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#POKE)() calls.

##### SERIAL(CHANNEL, ADDRESS, LENGTH)

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#SERIAL)

CHANNEL:  
  0x000..0x0fe    corresponds to gpio pin numbers; send 0x00 for LOW or 0xFF for HIGH  
  0x0ff           delay; length is taken to mean "duration" in microseconds (excl. overhead)  
  0x400..0x401    ws281x LED string (experimental)  

ADDRESS: The PICO-8 memory location to read from / write to.

LENGTH: Number of bytes to send. 1/8ths are allowed to send partial bit strings.

For example, to send a byte one bit at a time to a typical APA102 LED string:

VAL = 42          -- VALUE TO SEND  
DAT = 16 CLK = 15 -- DATA AND CLOCK PINS DEPEND ON DEVICE  
POKE(0X4300,0)    -- DATA TO SEND (SINGLE BYTES: 0 OR 0XFF)  
POKE(0X4301,0XFF)  
FOR B=0,7 DO  
  -- SEND THE BIT (HIGH FIRST)  
  SERIAL(DAT, BAND(VAL, SHL(1,7-B))>0 AND 0X4301 OR 0X4300, 1)  
  -- CYCLE THE CLOCK  
  SERIAL(CLK, 0X4301)  
  SERIAL(0XFF, 5) -- DELAY 5  
  SERIAL(CLK, 0X4300)  
  SERIAL(0XFF, 5) -- DELAY 5  
END  

Additional channels are available for bytestreams to and from the host operating system. These are intended to be most useful for UNIX-like environments while developing toolchains, and are not available while running a BBS or exported cart \[1\]. Maximum transfer rate in all cases is 64k/sec (blocks cpu).

0x800  dropped file   //  stat(120) returns TRUE when data is available  
0x802  dropped image  //  stat(121) returns TRUE when data is available  
0x804  stdin  
0x805  stdout  
0x806  file specified with: pico8 -i filename  
0x807  file specified with: pico8 -o filename  

Image files dropped into PICO-8 show up on channel 0x802 as a bytestream with a special format: The first 4 bytes are the image's width and height (2 bytes each little-endian, like PEEK2), followed by the image in reading order, one byte per pixel, colour-fitted to the display palette at the time the file was dropped.

\[1\] Channels 0x800 and 0x802 are available from exported binaries, but with a maximum file size of 256k, or 128x128 for images.

#### ■ HTML

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#HTML)

Cartridges exported as HTML / .js use a global array of integers (pico8\_gpio) to represent gpio pins. The shell HTML should define the array:

var pico8\_gpio = Array(128);
