2.5 Music Editor
----------------

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Music_Editor)

Music in PICO-8 is controlled by a sequence of 'patterns'. Each pattern is a list of 4 numbers indicating which SFX will be played on that channel.

[

### ▨ Flow control

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Flow_control)

Playback flow can be controlled using the 3 buttons at the top right.

When a pattern has finished playing, the next pattern is played unless:

\- there is no data left to play (music stops)  
\- a STOP command is set on that pattern (the third button)  
\- a LOOP BACK command is set (the 2nd button), in which case the music player searches  
  back for a pattern with the LOOP START command set (the first button) or returns to  
  pattern 0 if none is found.  

When a pattern has SFXes with different speeds, the pattern finishes playing when the left-most non-looping channel has finished playing. This can be used to set up double-time drum beats or unusual polyrhythms.

For time signatures like 3/4 where less than 32 rows should be played before jumping to the next pattern, the length of a SFX can be set by adjusting only the first loop position and leaving the second one as zero. This will show up in the sfx editor as "LEN" (for "Length") instead of "LOOP".

### ▨ Copying and Pasting Music

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Copying_and_Pasting_Music)

To select a range of patterns: click once on the first pattern in the pattern navigator, then shift-click on the last pattern. Selected patterns can be copied and pasted with CTRL-C and CTRL-V. When pasting into another cartridge, the SFX that each pattern points to will also be pasted (possibly with a different index) if it does not already exist.

### ▨ SFX Instruments

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#SFX_Instruments)

In addition to the 8 built-in instruments, custom instruments can be defined using the first 8 SFX. Use the toggle button to the right of the instruments to select an index, which will show up in the instrument channel as green instead of pink.

When an SFX instrument note is played, it essentially triggers that SFX, but alters the note's attributes:

  Pitch is added relative to C2  
  Volume is multiplied  
  Effects are applied on top of the SFX instrument's effects  
  Any filters that are on in the SFX instrument are enabled for that note  

For example, a simple tremolo effect could be implemented by defining an instrument in SFX 0 that rapidly alternates between volume 5 and 2. When using this instrument to play a note, the volume can further be altered as usual (via the volume channel or using the fade in/out effects). In this way, SFX instruments can be used to control combinations of detailed changes in volume, pitch and texture.

SFX instruments are only retriggered when the pitch changes, or the previous note has zero volume. This is useful for instruments that change more slowly over time. For example: a bell that gradually fades out. To invert this behaviour, effect 3 (normally 'drop') can be used when triggering the note. All other effect values have their usual meaning when triggering SFX instruments.

### ▨ Waveform Instruments

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Waveform_Instruments)

Waveform instruments function the same way as SFX instruments, but consist of a custom 64-byte looping waveform. Click on the waveform toggle button in the SFX editor to use SFX 0..7 as a waveform instrument. In this mode, samples can be drawn with the mouse.

### ▨ Scale Snapping

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Scale_Snapping)

When drawing notes in pitch mode, hold CTRL to snap to the currently defined scale. This is the C minor pentatonic scale by default, but can be customised using the scale editor mode. There is a little keyboard icon on the bottom right to toggle this. There are 2 tranpose buttons, 1 invert button, and 3 scale preset buttons:

Dim   Diminished 7th scale // invert to get a whole-half scale  
Maj   Major scale          // invert to get pentatonic  
Who   Whole tone scale     // invert to get.. the other whole tone scale  

Changing the scale does not alter the current SFX, it is only when drawing new notes with CTRL held down that the scale is applied.
