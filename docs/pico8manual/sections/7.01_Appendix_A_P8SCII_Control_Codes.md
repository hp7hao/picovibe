7.1 Appendix A: P8SCII Control Codes
------------------------------------

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Appendix_A__P8SCII_Control_Codes)

When printed with [**PRINT**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#PRINT)(), some characters have a special meaning that can be used to alter things like the cursor position and text rendering style. Control characters in PICO-8 are CHR(0)..CHR(15) and can be written as an escaped sequence ("\\n" for newline etc.)

Some of the control codes below take parameters which are written using a scheme that is a superset of hexadecimal format. That is, '0'..'f' also mean 0..15. But characters after 'f' are also accepted: 'g' means 16 and so on. Such parameters are written below as P0, P1.

For example, to print with a blue background ("\\#c") and dark gray foreground ("\\f5"):

PRINT("\\#C\\F5 BLUE ")  

The only side-effects on the draw state are changes in cursor position and foreground color; all other attributes are reset each time [**PRINT**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#PRINT)() is called.

#### ■ Control Codes

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Control_Codes)

0 "\\0"   terminate printing  
1 "\\\*"   repeat next character P0 times. ?"\\\*3a" --> aaa  
2 "\\#"   draw solid background with colour P0  
3 "\\-"   shift cursor horizontally by P0-16 pixels  
4 "\\|"   shift cursor vertically by P0-16 pixels  
5 "\\+"   shift cursor by P0-16, P1-16 pixels  
6 "\\^"   special command (see below)  
7 "\\a"   audio (see below)  
8 "\\b"   backspace  
9 "\\t"   tab  
a "\\n"   newline  
b "\\v"   decorate previous character (see below)  
c "\\f"   set foreground colour  
d "\\r"   carriage return  
e "\\014" switch to font defined at 0x5600  
f "\\015" switch to default font  

[

#### ■ Special Commands

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Special_Commands)

These commands all start with "\\^" and take up to 2 parameters (P0, P1) For example, to clear screen to dark blue: print("\\^c1")

1..9 skip 1,2,4,8,16,32..256 frames  
c cls to colour P0, set cursor to 0,0  
d set delay to P0 frames for every character printed  
g set cursor position to home  
h set home to cursor position  
j jump to absolute P0\*4, P1\*4 (in screen pixels)  
r set rhs character wrap boundary to P0\*4  
s set tab stop width to P0 pixels (used by "\\t")  
x set character width  (default: 4)  
y set character height (default: 6)  

[

#### ■ Rendering mode options

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Rendering_mode_options__)

// prefix these with "-" to disable: e.g. ?"\\^i on \\^-i off "

w wide mode: scales by 2x1  
t tall mode: scales by 1x2  
\= stripey mode: when wide or tall, draw only even pixels  
p pinball mode: equivalent to setting wide, tall and stripey  
i invert  
b border: toggle 1px padding on left and top // on by default  
\# solid background  // off by default, but enabled automatically by \\#  

[

#### ■ Raw memory writes

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Raw_memory_writes)

The following two commands take 4-character hex parameters:

@addrnnnn\[binstr\] poke nnnn bytes to address addr  
!addr\[binstr\]     poke all remaining characters to address addr  

For example, to write 4 bytes to video memory halfway down the screen:

\>?"\\^@70000004xxxxhello"  

[

#### ■ One-off characters

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#One_off_characters)

Character data can be specified and printed in-line using \\^. followed by 8 bytes of raw binary data, or \\^: followed by 8 2-digit hexadecimal values. The data format is the same as custom fonts; each byte specifies a row of 1-bit pixel values, with the low bit on the left.

\\^.\[8 chars of raw binary data\]  
\\^:\[16 chars of hexadecimal\]  

To print a cat:

\> ?"\\^:447cb67c3e7f0106"  

[

#### ■ Audio

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Audio_)

? ?"\\A" -- SINGLE BEEP ?"\\A12" -- PLAY EXISTING DATA AT SFX 12

If an sfx index is not specified, a non-active sfx between 60..63 is selected automatically. To fill the SFX with data before playback, the following commands can then be appended.

1\. (optional) SFX attributes must appear once at the start as they apply to the whole sound:

s P0     set the sfx speed  
l P0 P1  set the sfx loop start and end points  

2\. Note data:

Note are written as a..g, optionally followed by a sharp # or flat -, and octave number.

PRINT "\\ACE-G" -- MINOR TRIAD  

Empty notes Can be written with a dot:

PRINT "\\AC..E-..G" -- STACCATO MINOR TRIAD  

Note attribute commands apply to following notes:

i P0    set the instrument (default: 5)  
v P0    set the volume     (default: 5)  
x P0    set the effect     (default: 0)  
< > increase or decrease volume by 1

For example, to play a fast (speed 4), staccato (effect 5) arpeggio starting at C1:

PRINT "\\AS4X5C1EGC2EGC3EGC4"  

[

#### ■ Decoration Characters

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Decoration_Characters)

The control character \\v can be used to decorate the last printed character with another character at a given offset, without needing to otherwise manage the cursor position. After the decorating character is printed, the previous cursor position is restored.

The format is \\v P0 char, where P0 is a number giving the desired offset, and char is any character to print at that offset (relative to the previous printed character).

The offset has x packed into the lowest 2 bits, and starts (-2,-8) in reading order. So 3 means (+1, -8), 4 means (-2, -7) and so on.

For example, to write "cafÃ©!", using a comma to draw the acute accent:

PRINT"\\NCAFE\\VB,!"  

In this case P0 is 'b', which is read as the number 11. So the comma is drawn at:

x = (11%4)-2 = 1  
y = (11\\4)-8 = -6  

[

#### ■ Custom Font

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Custom_Font)

A custom font can be defined at 0x5600, consisting of 8 bytes per character \* 256 characters = 2048 bytes. Each character is an 8x8 bitfield (1 bit/pixel), where starting from the top, each row is a single byte starting with 0x1 on the left.

The first 128 bytes (characters 0~15 are never drawn) describe attributes of the font:

0x5600 character width in pixels (can be more than 8, but only 8 pixels are drawn)  
0x5601 character width for character 128 and above  
0x5602 character height in pixels  
0x5603 draw offset x  
0x5604 draw offset y  
0x5605 flags: 0x1 apply\_size\_adjustments  0x2: apply tabs relative to cursor home  
0x5606 tab width in pixels (used only when alt font is drawn)  
0x5607 unused  

The remaining 120 bytes are used to adjust the width and vertical offset of characters 16..255. Each nibble (low nibbles first) describes the adjustments for one characters:

bits 0x7: adjust character width by 0,1,2,3,-4,-3,-2,-1  
bit  0x8: when set, draw the character one pixel higher (useful for latin accents)  

[

#### ■ Default Attributes

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Default_Attributes)

Although attributes are reset every time [**PRINT**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#PRINT)() is called, it is possible to set their default values by writing to memory addresses 0x5f58..0x5f5b.

0x5f58 // bitfield  
  0x1  when set to 0x1, bits 1..7 are observed:  
  0x2  padding  
  0x4  wide  
  0x8  tall  
  0x10 solid background  
  0x20 invert  
  0x40 stripey (when wide or tall)  
  0x80 use custom font

    // e.g. poke(0x5f58, 0x1 | 0x2 | 0x4 | 0x8 | 0x20 | 0x40)  -- pinball everywhere

0x5f59 char\_w   (low nibble), char\_h   (high)  
0x5f5a char\_w2  (low nibble), tab\_w    (high)  
0x5f5b offset\_x (low nibble), offset\_y (high)

  // any nibbles equal to 0 are ignored  
// tab\_w (global tab width) values are mapped to 4..60
