SPLORE is a built-in utility for browsing and organising both local and bbs (online) cartridges. Type SPLORE \[enter\] to launch it, or launch PICO-8 with -splore.

It is possible to control SPLORE entirely with a joystick:

LEFT and RIGHT to navigate lists of cartridges  
UP AND DOWN to select items in each list  
X,O or MENU to launch the cartridge  

While inside a cart, press MENU to favourite a cartridge or exit to splore. If you're using a keyboard, it's also possible to press F to favourite an item while it is selected in the cartridge list view.

When viewing a list of BBS carts, use the top list item to re-download a list of cartridges. If you are offline, the last downloaded list is displayed, and it is still possible to play any cartridges you have downloaded.

If you have installed PICO-8 on a machine with no internet access, you can also use INSTALL\_GAMES to add a small selection of pre-installed BBS carts to /games
