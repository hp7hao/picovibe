1.10 Sharing Cartridges
-----------------------

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#_Sharing_Cartridges)

There are three ways to share carts made in PICO-8:

1\. Share the .p8 or .p8.png file directly with other PICO-8 users

Type FOLDER to open the current folder in your host operating system.

2\. Post the cart on the Lexaloffe BBS to get a web-playable version

3\. Export the cartridge to a stand-alone html/js or native binary player (see the exporters section for details)
