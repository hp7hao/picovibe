1.5 Loading and Saving
----------------------

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#_Loading_and_Saving)

When using LOAD and SAVE, the .P8 extension can be omitted and is added automatically.

\> SAVE FOO  
SAVED FOO.P8  

Cartridge files can also be dragged and dropped into PICO-8's window to load them.

Using .p8.png filename extension will write the cartridge in a special image format that looks like a cartridge. Using .p8.rom" writes in a raw 32k binary format.

Use a filename of "@clip" to load or save to the clipboard.

Use a filename of "@url" to save to clipboard as a pico-8-edu.com url if it can be encoded in 2040 characters (code and gfx only).

Once a cartridge has been loaded or saved, it can also be quick-saved with CTRL-S

To generate a label image saved with the cart, run the program first and press CTRL-7 to grab whatever is on the screen. The first two lines of the program starting with '--' are also drawn to the cart's label.

#### ■ Code size restrictions for .p8.png / .p8.rom formats

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Code_size_restrictions_for_)

When saving in .png or .rom format, the compressed size of the code must be less than 15360 bytes so that the total data is <= 32k.

To find out the current size of your code, use the INFO command. The compressed size limit is not enforced for saving in .p8 format.
