❹ Lua Syntax Primer
-------------------

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Lua_Syntax_Primer)

PICO-8 programs are written using Lua syntax, but do not use the standard Lua library. The following is a brief summary of essential Lua syntax.

For more details, or to find out about proper Lua, see www.lua.org.

### ▨ Types and assignment

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Types_and_assignment)

Types in Lua are numbers, strings, booleans and tables:

NUM = 12/100  
S = "THIS IS A STRING"  
B = FALSE  
T = {1,2,3}  

Numbers in PICO-8 are all 16:16 fixed point. They range from -32768.0 to 32767.99999

Hexadecimal notation with optional fractional parts can be used:

?0x11        -- 17  
?0x11.4000   -- 17.25  

Numbers written in decimal are rounded to the closest fixed point value. To see the 32-bit hexadecimal representation, use PRINT(TOSTR(VAL,TRUE)):

?TOSTR(-32768,TRUE)      -- 0x8000.0000  
?TOSTR(32767.99999,TRUE) -- 0X7FFF.FFFF  

Dividing by zero evaluates to 0x7fff.ffff if positive, or -0x7fff.ffff if negative.

### ▨ Conditionals

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Conditionals)

IF NOT B THEN  
  PRINT("B IS FALSE")  
ELSE  
  PRINT("B IS NOT FALSE")  
END  

\-- with ELSEIF

IF X == 0 THEN  
  PRINT("X IS 0")  
ELSEIF X < 0 THEN  
  PRINT("X IS NEGATIVE")  
ELSE  
  PRINT("X IS POSITIVE")  
END  

IF (4 == 4) THEN PRINT("EQUAL") END  
IF (4 ~= 3) THEN PRINT("NOT EQUAL") END  
IF (4 <= 4) THEN PRINT("LESS THAN OR EQUAL") END  
IF (4 > 3) THEN PRINT("MORE THAN") END  

[

### ▨ Loops

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Loops)

Loop ranges are inclusive:

FOR X=1,5 DO  
  PRINT(X)  
END  
\-- PRINTS 1,2,3,4,5  

X = 1  
WHILE(X <= 5) DO  
  PRINT(X)  
  X = X + 1  
END  

FOR X=1,10,3 DO PRINT(X) END   -- 1,4,7,10  

FOR X=5,1,-2 DO PRINT(X) END  -- 5,3,1  

[

### ▨ Functions and Local Variables

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Functions_and_Local_Variables)

Variables declared as LOCAL are scoped to their containing block of code (for example, inside a FUNCTION, a FOR loop, or IF THEN END statement).

Y=0  
FUNCTION PLUSONE(X)  
  LOCAL Y = X+1  
  RETURN Y  
END  
PRINT(PLUSONE(2)) -- 3  
PRINT(Y)          -- 0  

[

### ▨ Tables

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Tables)

In Lua, tables are a collection of key-value pairs where the key and value types can both be mixed. They can be used as arrays by indexing them with integers.

A={} -- CREATE AN EMPTY TABLE  
A\[1\] = "BLAH"  
A\[2\] = 42  
A\["FOO"\] = {1,2,3}  

Arrays use 1-based indexing by default:

\> A = {11,12,13,14}  
\> PRINT(A\[2\]) -- 12  

But if you prefer 0-based arrays, just write something the zeroth slot:

\> A = {\[0\]=10,11,12,13,14}  

Tables with 1-based integer indexes are special though. The length of such an array can be found with the # operator, and PICO-8 uses such arrays to implement ADD, DEL, DELI, ALL and FOREACH functions.

\> PRINT(#A)   -- 4  
\> ADD(A, 15)  
\> PRINT(#A)   -- 5  

Indexes that are strings can be written using dot notation

PLAYER = {}  
PLAYER.X = 2 -- is equivalent to PLAYER\["X"\]  
PLAYER.Y = 3  

See the [**Table\_Functions**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Table_Functions) section for more details.

### ▨ PICO-8 Shorthand

](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#PICO_8_Shorthand)

PICO-8 also allows several non-standard, shorter ways to write common patterns.

1\. IF THEN END statements, and WHILE THEN END can be written on a single line with:

IF (NOT B) I=1 J=2  

Is equivalent to:

IF NOT B THEN I=1 J=2 END  

Note that brackets around the short-hand condition are required.

2\. Assignment operators

Shorthand assignment operators can also be used if the whole statement is on one line. They can be constructed by appending a '=' to any binary operator, including arithmetic (+=, -= ..), bitwise (&=, |= ..) or the string concatenation operator (..=)

A += 2   -- EQUIVALENT TO: A = A + 2  

3\. != operator

Not shorthand, but pico-8 also accepts != instead of ~= for "not equal to"

PRINT(1 != 2) -- TRUE  
PRINT("FOO" == "FOO") -- TRUE (STRING ARE INTERNED)
